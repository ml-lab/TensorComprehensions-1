# Purpose: The purpose of this caffe2 conda package is to remove the caffe2 submodule
# from inside TC completely. But we still want to be able to run tests with caffe2,
# so we install caffe2 via conda package built here, and get the caffe2 libs directly.
#
# How: You will need glog/gflags/protobuf conda packages that TC is compatible with.
# for that, run conda_build_tc.sh script to build those packages and then run
# this script to build caffe2 conda package.
#
# Use: The caffe2 conda package is to be used to install TC in conda environment
# but TC should build from source using the conda package dependencies - isl-tc,
# glog, gflags, protobuf, llvm-tapir5, caffe2.
#
# Don't: Please don't make caffe2 a dependency in the TC conda package. This makes
# the package size big and we don't want that. Rather build TC using conda deps.
